\section{Embedding the Static Plots}{

If \code{save==TRUE}, the plot(s) is written to a .png file. (For
\code{view_xifti_surface}, if \code{length(idx) > 1}, each \code{idx} will
be written to a separate image file.) You can use
\code{\link[knitr]{include_graphics}} to embed an image file in an R
Markdown document. If \code{close_after_save==TRUE}, the return value of this
function call is the name(s) of the image file(s) that were written, so it
can be used directly to display the image.

There's an additional way to embed an image of this plot without writing a
.png file: use \code{save==FALSE} and set the chunk options
\code{rgl=TRUE, format="png"}. You will probably need to tweak the image
dimensions e.g. \code{fig.width=8, fig.height=5} in the chunk options,
because it uses the defaults from RMarkdown/Knitr instead of what makes
sense based on the dimensions of the Open GL window.
