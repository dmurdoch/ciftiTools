Description: CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in "gray-ordinates", which 
    represent the gray matter as cortical surface vertices (left and right) and
    subcortical voxels (cerebellum, basal ganglia, and other deep gray matter). 
    'ciftiTools' uses the Connectome Workbench to read CIFTI files into R and
    apply common pre-processing steps (e.g. smoothing, resampling). It also
    provides tools for visualizing the cortical surface with GIFTI files, and
    for visualizing the subcortical volume.
